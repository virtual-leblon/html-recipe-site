# odin-recipes
This is my first ever project, as proposed by The Odin Project, where I'm mainly learning how to code from.
This recipe web site is entirely made on HTML and consists of headings, paragraphs, images, ordered and unordered lists, and relative links; basically all the tools I learned until now.
There was a lot I wanted to make that was beyond my knowledge, specially style-wise, but as a first project I decided to try with what I knew unless completely necessary. For this reason you can see weird coding such as empty <img> elements just to make more space between lines. The only thing I searched was how to re-size images, so they were similar between them.
There's a main page, and three other pages, one for each recipe.
Also this is my first time using GIT and GitHub, I tried to keep my commits as clear and properly divided as possible, but I don't feel confortable yet as precisely when and how to use it.
Eager to continue this journey!
