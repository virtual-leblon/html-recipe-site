        <h3>This is the look of the plate as served traditionally. The meat, the potatoes, some olive oil, parsley and paprika. Simple and delicious! And it's easy!</h3>
        <p>This mediterranean delicacy, also really popular in Japan and South Korea, is the favorite of many who gave it a chance. Tender meat, not a strong sea flavor (as many other sea creatures), and freshness is what makes us love it.</p>
