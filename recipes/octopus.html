        <h3>This is the look of the plate as served traditionally. The meat, the potatoes, some olive oil, parsley and paprika. Simple and delicious! And it's easy!</h3>
        <p>This mediterranean delicacy, also really popular in Japan and South Korea, is the favorite of many who gave it a chance. Tender meat, not a strong sea flavor (as many other sea creatures), and freshness is what makes us love it.</p>
        <p>In this recipe we are going to make an octopus <em>a la gallega</em>, as it's served in the <em>Moby-Dick-like</em> region of Galicia, in the north west of Spain, just besides Portugal; and give it a little twist of our own. But if you want to keep it simple, go ahead! Just cook the octopus as we show and season with the classics, it won't disappoint you. Ready to learn your next favorite recipe? Grab a bottle of red wine and off we go, to the lands of <em>flamenco</em> and the best foods in the whole world!</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chopped onion, garlic cloves, bay leaf, paprika, salt, and 1 tablespoon olive oil into saucepan. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until onions start to soften, about 5 minutes. Add white wine to create the braising liquid. Bring to a simmer.</li> 
            <li>Transfer octopus into braising liquid, turning to coat with the liquid. Cover; reduce heat to low. Simmer 20 minutes and turn octopus over. Continue cooking until octopus is tender, another 40 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat; transfer octopus to a large bowl. Pour braising liquid over octopus. Place bowl above a bowl of ice water to cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Cover bowl with plastic wrap when octopus and liquid are cool. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Transfer octopus to a work surface and mop off braising juices with paper towels; remove as much of the purple skin as you want. Cut octopus into 3 or 4 serving-size pieces. Brush with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Transfer braising liquid to saucepan. Bring to a boil; remove from heat. Strain out solids; transfer liquid to a mixing bowl; let cool about 10 minutes. Stir in lemon juice, extra-virgin olive oil, parsley, salt, and cayenne pepper to make the serving sauce.</li>
            <li>Heat a grill pan or outdoor grill to high heat. Transfer octopus pieces to grill. Cook until flesh is seared, almost charred, 3 or 4 minutes. Turn and cook other side until dark brown, caramelized, and heated through, another 3 or 4 minutes. Transfer to a platter.</li>
            <li>Slice octopus into fairly thick diagonal slices. Place on a serving dish. Spoon braising liquid mixture over the top. Dust with a bit of cayenne pepper, if desired.</li>
