        <h3>This is the look of the plate as served traditionally. The meat, the potatoes, some olive oil, parsley and paprika. Simple and delicious! And it's easy!</h3>
        <p>This mediterranean delicacy, also really popular in Japan and South Korea, is the favorite of many who gave it a chance. Tender meat, not a strong sea flavor (as many other sea creatures), and freshness is what makes us love it.</p>
        <p>In this recipe we are going to make an octopus <em>a la gallega</em>, as it's served in the <em>Moby-Dick-like</em> region of Galicia, in the north west of Spain, just besides Portugal; and give it a little twist of our own. But if you want to keep it simple, go ahead! Just cook the octopus as we show and season with the classics, it won't disappoint you. Ready to learn your next favorite recipe? Grab a bottle of red wine and off we go, to the lands of <em>flamenco</em> and the best foods in the whole world!</p>
